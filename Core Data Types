    char grade = 'A'; // you can put only one single character

    int number = 12313; // whole number (1,2,3) NO DECÄ°MAL, you can write negative numbers to int number = -123;

    decimal money = 223123; // I recommend to use this for money or other serious stuffs

    //float little_ones = 3.2; // if you write like you will get an error if you want to read about it here is the link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6942803/why-c-sharp-decimals-cant-be-initialized-without-the-m-suffix#6942858

    double gpa = 4.2; // this is middle of the things and most developers are using double because more secure than float and you know not important than decimal so i recommend you to use double

    bool isMale = true; // This is very basic just true or false but you can do amazing things with booleans

    // IMPORTANT
    // if you don't want to store this types into the variable, so... you don't need to store it guys, let me give you some examples:

    Console.WriteLine("Hello"); // you don't need to store in variable

    Console.WriteLine(30);

    Console.WriteLine(3.32);

    Console.WriteLine(true);


    Console.ReadLine();
  }
}
